# Tier-1 Baseline Python Service

This project represents a Tier-1 architecture baseline.

## Characteristics
- Single application service
- In-memory data storage
- No external dependencies
- No caching or async processing

## Purpose
The goal of Tier-1 is to establish a functional baseline
before introducing databases, caching, queues, or infrastructure.

This service will be evolved step-by-step into higher-tier
architectures to demonstrate scalability and DevOps design decisions.
